# Front Desk Logger
Some years ago I worked at the reception of a hotel and one of the things we used to find tricky leaving notes for next shifts. We used to write down everything on a paper or little notebook and pass that over. A lot of times we found ourselves trying to undertand what the other person wrote or which notes were new and which ones were old. Keeping this strugle in mind I build the app I wish I had back then.
